# DFCalculator
Calculator for various DF related stuff.

## Features:
- In development:
    - [Weapon Calculator](https://jose96xd.github.io/DF_Tools/): To calculate weapon related stuff like momentum, penetration and similar against N layers of armor.
        TODO:
        - Add more races.
    - Layer Permit Checker: To calculate the cloth and armor a creature can wear and helm with modded clothes.  

I will be adding more as I finish the ones in development. Also, as I learn more js and CSS I will try to make them prettier and more efficient.
For now, all the js is native with no external code, so I think it should (at least) be smallish.

## General use:
Each module is more or less independent. I will try to make sure that all the functionalities that one would like are inside each module to avoid needing to switch between them in excess.

## Note:
I'm making this website as fast as I can so don't expect too much beauty. I will try to come back to clean everything once I have more time.
I'm learning HTML, CSS and js at the same time as I do this, so for now, functionality will be prioritized over everything else.
